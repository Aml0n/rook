## current features
- the (superior) Chess Clock Method — never break your flow state again.
- automatic timer switching — unlike a standard chess clock, these timers will automatically set the other one to start running when it hits zero.
- timer customization — select from a handful of presets, or set your own times.
- simple — no overcomplications, just set the timers and run it.
- sleek — a stylish UI to set the mood. 
- light mode — i know... sorry.

## future features
- dark/light mode — whichever you prefer.
- sound effects — minimal, but highly interactive experience.
- tab title time — check your time at a glance as you work in another tab.

## what is the Chess Clock Method?
(you may want to read the original blog post linked above)

the Chess Clock Method is proposed as a replacement to the Pomodoro technique. traditionally, Pomodoro involves 25 minutes of studying followed by 5 minutes of break.

however, this system is flawed: having strictly set breaks interrupts the natural flow state and momentum that you've built up over the past 25 minutes.

the chess clock method is designed to allow the user to take breaks whenever they want while still providing the structure of Pomodoro.


### *how does it work?*

you have two timers: a "working" timer and a "break" timer.

whenever the working timer is running, you *must* be working. 
whenever the break timer is running, you *must* be taking a break.

at all times, one of the timers will be on and the other will be off. when you take a break, you can switch the break timer on, and vice versa for the working timer. the session is done when both timers hit zero.

this allows the user to take a break or begin working at any moment, while still limiting the amount of time spent in breaks. 

typically, the Chess Clock Method is used with 70 minutes of working and 20 minutes of break (aka 70-20 CC). in 70-20 CC, the user will ultimately spend 90 minutes in one session.
